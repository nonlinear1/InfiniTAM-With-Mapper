	 * Dummy tracker which relays pose information from a file.
	 * The currently supported file format is the ground truth odometry information from
	 * the KITTI odometry dataset.
	 *
	 * Note that this information is not a 100% "cheaty" ground truth computed using, e.g.,
	 * manual annotation or beacons, but the one recorded by the vehicle's IMG/GPS module.
	 *
	 * In the future, nevertheless, it would be much cooler to just do this using sparse-to-dense
	 * odometry from stereo (and maybe lidar) data.
